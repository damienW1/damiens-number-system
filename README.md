# Please look at symbols on the Images folder.

# Red sticks indicate groups of things such as 2 and 1 make 3.
## Idea
I got my idea from just drawing random symbols, and made some stuff.
### Numbers that have their own symbol:

0 is just a straight stick.
1 is a smaller stick
2 is just like 1, just a different direction.
4 is like 3 just a different direction
8 is a stick in the middle
16 is a stick on the top.
